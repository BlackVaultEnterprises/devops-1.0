# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This CI/CD pipeline is designed for the DevOps 1.0 project and implements a comprehensive automated workflow using GitHub Actions. The pipeline covers the entire software development lifecycle from code quality checks to production deployment.

## Pipeline Architecture

### üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Stages

1. **Code Quality & Security** - Static analysis, linting, and security scanning
2. **Unit Testing** - Automated testing across multiple Node.js and Python versions
3. **Integration Testing** - Docker-based integration tests
4. **Build & Package** - Docker image building and artifact creation
5. **Deploy to Staging** - Automated deployment to staging environment
6. **Performance Testing** - Load testing with K6
7. **Security Scanning** - Vulnerability scanning with Trivy and OWASP ZAP
8. **Infrastructure Testing** - Terraform validation and testing
9. **Deploy to Production** - Production deployment with health checks
10. **Monitoring Setup** - Automated monitoring and alerting configuration

### üîÑ Workflow Triggers

- **Push to main/master** - Triggers full pipeline including production deployment
- **Push to develop** - Triggers pipeline up to staging deployment
- **Pull Requests** - Triggers code quality and testing stages
- **Manual Dispatch** - Allows manual pipeline execution

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The pipeline uses the following environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18'

## Local Development

### Running the Pipeline Locally

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run code quality checks**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run security:audit
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

4. **Build Docker image**:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:build
   ```
